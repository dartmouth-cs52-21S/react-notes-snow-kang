*Snow's Notes*

## What Worked Well
- The animal headers went a lot more smoothly than I had anticipated. After I drew the first animal header, the other ones were really easy to make by just slightly redrawing the facial expression and changing the ears, while keeping the body dimensions the same so that they fit on the note. 

## What Didn't
- 

## Extra Credit
- Drew animal headers and allow users to change the header for each note
- Google authentication with "created by" portion
